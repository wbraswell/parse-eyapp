=head2 Comments

Comments are either Perl style, from C<#>
up to the end of line, or C style, enclosed between  C</*> and C<*/>.

=head2 Syntactic Variables, Symbolic Tokens and String Literals

Two kind of symbols may appear inside a Parse::Eyapp program:
I<Non-terminal> symbols or I<syntactic variables>, 
called also I<left-hand-side> symbols
and I<Terminal> symbols, called
also I<Tokens>.

Tokens are the symbols the lexical analyzer function returns to the parser.
There are two kinds of tokens: I<symbolic tokens> and I<string
literals>.

I<Syntactic variables> and I<symbolic tokens> identifiers must conform
to the regular expression C<[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*>.

When building the syntax tree (i.e. when running under the C<%tree>
directive) I<symbolic tokens> will be considered I<semantic tokens> (see section
L</Syntactic and Semantic tokens>). I<Symbolic tokens> yield nodes
in the Abstract Syntax Tree.

String literals are enclosed in single quotes and can contain almost
anything. They will be received by the parser as double-quoted strings. 
Any special character as C<'"'>, C<'$'> and C<'@'> is escaped.
To have a single quote inside a literal, escape it with '\'.

When building the syntax tree (i.e. when running under the C<%tree>
directive) I<string literals> will be considered I<syntactic tokens> (see section
L</Syntactic and Semantic tokens>). I<Syntactic tokens> do not produce
nodes in the Abstract Syntax Tree.

The examples used along this document can be found in the directory 
C<examples/eyapplanguageref> accompanying this distribution.

=head2 Parts of an C<eyapp> Program

An Eyapp program has three parts called head, body and tail: 

                                 eyapp: head body tail ;

Each part is separated from the former by the symbol C<%%>:

                                 head: headsec '%%'
                                 body: rulesec '%%'

=head1 THE HEAD SECTION

The head section contains a list of declarations 

                                 headsec:  decl *

There are different kinds of declarations. 

This reference does not 
fully describes all the declarations that are shared with C<yacc> and 
L<yapp>. 

=head2 Example of Head Section

In this and the next sections we will describe the basics
of the Eyapp language using the file C<examples/eyapplanguageref/Calc.eyp> 
that accompanies this distribution. This file implements a trivial 
calculator. Here is the header section:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$   sed -ne '1,11p' Calc.eyp | cat -n
     1  # examples/eyapplanguageref/Calc.eyp
     2  %right  '='
     3  %left   '-' '+'
     4  %left   '*' '/'
     5  %left   NEG
     6  %right  '^'
     7  %{
     8  my %s; # symbol table
     9  %}
    10
    11  %%


=head2 Declarations and Precedence

Lines 2-5 declare several tokens. The usual way to declare
tokens is through the C<%token> directive. The declarations 
C<%nonassoc>, C<%left> and C<%right> 
not only declare the tokens but also associate a I<priority> with them.  
Tokens declared in the same line have the same precedence. 
Tokens declared with these directives in lines below have more
precedence than those declared above. Thus, in the example
above
we are saying that C<"+"> and C<"-"> have the same precedence
but higher precedence than =. The final effect of C<"-">
having greater precedence than = will be that an
expression like:

                        a = 4 - 5

will be interpreted as
 
                        a = (4 - 5)

and not as

                        (a = 4) - 5

The use of the C<%left> indicates that - in case of ambiguity 
and a match between precedences - the parser must build the tree corresponding
to a left parenthesizing. Thus, the expression

                         4 - 5 - 9

will be interpreted as

                         (4 - 5) - 9

You can refer to the token end-of-input in the header section using the string C<''> (for example
to give it some priority, see the example in C<examples/debuggingtut/typicalrrwithprec.eyp>). 

=head2 Header Code

Perl code surrounded by C<%{> and C<%}>
can be inserted in the head section. Such code will be inserted in the module
generated by C<eyapp> near the beginning. Therefore, declarations like the
one of the calculator symbol table C<%s>

  7  %{
  8  my %s; # symbol table
  9  %}

will be visible from almost any point in the file.

=head2 The Start Symbol of the Grammar

C<%start program> declares C<program> as the start symbol of 
the grammar. When C<%start> is not
used, the first rule in the body section will be used.

=head2 Expect

The C<%expect #NUMBER> directive works as in C<bison> 
and  suppress warnings when the number of Shift/Reduce
conflicts is exactly C<#NUMBER>. 

The directive has been extended to be called with two numbers:

  %expect NUMSHIFTRED NUMREDRED

no warnings will be emitted if the number of shift-reduce 
conflicts is exactly C<NUMSHIFTRED> and the number of reduce-reduce
conflicts is C<NUMREDRED>.

=head2 Type and Union

C oriented declarations like C<%type> and C<%union> are
parsed but ignored.

=head2 The C<%strict> Directive

[%
  PROCESS strictdirective 
%]

=head2 The C<%prefix> Directive

The C<%prefix> directive 
is equivalent to the use of the C<yyprefix>. The node classes are prefixed
with the specified prefix

  %prefix Some::Prefix::

See the example in C<examples/eyapplanguageref/alias_and_yyprefix.pl>.
See also section L<Parse::Eyapp::defaultactionsintro/Grammar Reuse>
for an example that does not involve the C<%tree> directive.

=head2 Default Action Directive

In C<Parse::Eyapp> you can modify the default action 
using the C<%defaultaction { Perl code }>
directive. See section L<DEFAULT ACTIONS>.
The examples C<examples/eyapplanguageref/Postfix.eyp> and 
C<examples/eyapplanguageref/Lhs.eyp> illustrate the use of the directive.

=head2 Tree Construction Directives

C<Parse::Eyapp> facilitates the construction of concrete syntax trees and 
abstract syntax trees (abbreviated AST from now on) through the C<%tree>
and C<%metatree> directives. See sections
L<ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREES: %tree AND %name>
and
L<Parse::Eyapp::translationschemestut>. 

=head2 Tokens and the Abstract Syntax Tree

The new token declaration directives C<%syntactic token> and
C<%semantic token> can change the way C<eyapp> builds the abstract syntax tree.
See section L<Syntactic and Semantic tokens>.

=head2 The C<%nocompact> directive

This directive influences the generation of the LALR tables.
They will not be compacted and the tokens
for the C<DEFAULT> reduction will be explicitly set.
It can be used to produce an C<.output> file (option C<-v>)
with more information.


=head1 THE BODY

The body section contains the rules describing the grammar:

                       body:   rules * '%%'
                       rules:  IDENT ':' rhss ';'  
                       rhss:   (optname rhs (prec epscode)?) <+ '|'>  


=head2 Rules

A rule is made of a left-hand-side symbol (the I<syntactic variable>), 
followed by a C<':'> and one
or more I<right-hand-sides> (or I<productions>)
 separated by C<'|'> and terminated by a C<';'>
like in:

                          exp: 
                               exp '+' exp
                            |  exp '-' exp
                            |  NUM
                          ;

A I<production> (I<right hand side>) may be empty:

                          input:   
                               /* empty */
                            |  input line
                          ;

The former two productions can be abbreviated as

                          input: 
                               line *
                          ;

The operators C<*>, C<+> and C<?> are presented in section
L</LISTS AND OPTIONALS>.

A I<syntactic variable cannot appear more than once as
a rule name> (This differs from C<yacc>).  So you can't 
write

    thing: foo bar ;
    thing: foo baz ;

instead, write:

    thing: 
           foo bar 
         | foo baz 
    ;


=head2 Semantic Values and Semantic Actions


In C<Parse::Eyapp> 
a production rule 

                          A -> X_1 X_2 ... X_n

can be followed by a 
I<semantic action>:

                    A -> X_1 X_2 ... X_n { Perl Code }

Such
semantic action is nothing but Perl code that will be treated 
as an anonymous subroutine.  The semantic action associated 
with production rule C<A -E<gt> X_1 X_2 ... X_n>  is executed
after any actions associated with the subtrees of C<X_1>,
C<X_2>, ..., C<X_n>.
C<Eyapp> parsers build the syntax tree using a left-right
bottom-up traverse of the syntax tree. Each times
the Parser visits the node associated with the 
production C<A -E<gt> X_1 X_2 ... X_n>
the associated semantic action is called. 
Associated with each symbol
of a L<Parse::Eyapp> grammar there is a scalar I<Semantic Value>
or I<Attribute>. The semantic values of terminals are provided
by the lexical analyzer. In the calculator example
(see file C<examples/eyapplanguageref/Calc.yp> in the distribution),
the semantic value associated with an expression
is its numeric value. Thus in the rule:

                       exp '+' exp { $_[1] + $_[3] }

C<$_[1]> refers to the attribute of the first C<exp>, C<$_[2]> 
is the attribute associated with C<'+'>, which is the second component of the 
pair provided by the lexical analyzer and C<$_[3]> refers to the attribute of 
the second C<exp>.

When the semantic action/anonymous subroutine is called,
the arguments are as follows:

=over 

=item * 

C<$_[1]> to C<$_[n]> are the attributes of
the symbols C<X_1>, C<X_2>, ..., C<X_n>. 
Just as C<$1> to C<$n> in C<yacc>,

=item * 

C<$_[0]> is the parser object itself.
Having C<$_[0]> being the parser object itself allows you to call
parser methods. Most C<yacc> macros have been converted into
parser methods. See section L<Parse::Eyapp/METHODS AVAILABLE IN THE GENERATED CLASS>.

=back 

The returned value will be the attribute associated 
with the left hand side of the production.

Names can be given to the attributes using the dot notation
(see file C<examples/eyapplanguageref/CalcSimple.eyp>):

                     exp.left '+' exp.right { $left + $right }

See section L<NAMES FOR ATTRIBUTES> for more details about the I<dot> and I<dollar> 
notations.

If no action is specified and no C<%defaultaction> is specified
the default action 
                         
                               { $_[1] }

will be executed instead. See section L</DEFAULT ACTIONS> to know more.

=head2 Actions in Mid-Rule

Actions can be inserted in the middle of a production like in:

 block: '{'.bracket { $ids->begin_scope(); } declaration*.decs statement*.sts '}' { ... }

A middle production action is managed by inserting a new rule in the grammar and associating
the semantic action with it:

                     Temp: /* empty */ { $ids->begin_scope(); }

Middle production actions can refer to the attributes on its left. They count
as one of the components of the production. Thus the program:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ cat intermediateaction2.yp 
  %%
  S:  'a' { $_[1]x4 }.mid 'a' { print "\n<<$_[2], $mid, $_[3]>>\n"; }
  ;
  %%



The auxiliar syntactic variables are named C<@#position-#order> where C<#position>
is the position of the action in the rhs and C<order> is an ordinal number. See
the C<.output> file for the former example:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ eyapp -v intermediateaction2.yp
  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ sed -ne '1,5p' intermediateaction2.output
  Rules:
  ------
  0:  $start -> S $end
  1:  S -> 'a' @1-1 'a'
  2:  @1-1 -> /* empty */

We can build an executable C<ia.pl> from the former grammar using C<eyapp> option C<-C>:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ eyapp -C -o ia.pl intermediateaction2.yp 

The C<main>, error and lexer methods are provided by C<Parse::Eyapp>.
When given input C<aa> the execution will produce as output C<aaaa, aaaa, a>. The option
C<-d> activates the debug mode, the option C<-c> tells the program to get the input from the command line::

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ ./ia.pl -d -c 'aa'
  ----------------------------------------
  In state 0:
  Stack: 0
  Need token. Got >a<
  Shift and go to state 2.
  ----------------------------------------
  In state 2:
  Stack: 0->'a'->2
  Don't need token.
  Reduce using rule 2 (@1-1 --> /* empty */): Back to state 2, then go to state 4.
  ----------------------------------------
  In state 4:
  Stack: 0->'a'->2->'@1-1'->4
  Need token. Got >a<
  Shift and go to state 5.
  ----------------------------------------
  In state 5:
  Stack: 0->'a'->2->'@1-1'->4->'a'->5
  Don't need token.
  Reduce using rule 1 (S --> a @1-1 a): 
  <<aaaa, aaaa, a>>
  Back to state 0, then go to state 1.
  ----------------------------------------
  In state 1:
  Stack: 0->'S'->1
  Need token. Got ><
  Shift and go to state 3.
  ----------------------------------------
  In state 3:
  Stack: 0->'S'->1->''->3
  Don't need token.
  Accept.


=head2 Example of Body Section

Following with the calculator example, the body is:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ sed -ne '12,48p' Calc.eyp | cat -n
     1  start:
     2      input { \%s }
     3  ;
     4
     5  input: line *
     6  ;
     7
     8  line:
     9    '\n'         { undef }
    10    | exp '\n'   { print "$_[1]\n" if defined($_[1]); $_[1] }
    11    | error  '\n'
    12        {
    13          $_[0]->YYErrok;
    14          undef
    15        }
    16  ;
    17
    18  exp:
    19      NUM
    20    | $VAR                   { $s{$VAR} }
    21    | $VAR '=' $exp          { $s{$VAR} = $exp }
    22    | exp.left '+' exp.right { $left + $right }
    23    | exp.left '-' exp.right { $left - $right }
    24    | exp.left '*' exp.right { $left * $right }
    25    | exp.left '/' exp.right
    26      {
    27         $_[3] and return($_[1] / $_[3]);
    28         $_[0]->YYData->{ERRMSG} = "Illegal division by zero.\n";
    29         $_[0]->YYError; # Pretend that a syntactic error occurred: _Error will be called
    30         undef
    31      }
    32    | '-' $exp %prec NEG     { -$exp }
    33    | exp.left '^' exp.right { $left ** $right }
    34    | '(' $exp ')'           { $exp }
    35  ;
    36
    37  %%

This example does not uses any of the Eyapp extensions (with the exception of the 
C<*> operator at line 5) and the dot and dollar notations. 

=head2 Solving Ambiguities and Conflicts

When Eyapp analyzes a grammar like:

  examples/eyapplanguageref$ cat -n ambiguities.eyp
     1  %%
     2  exp:
     3      NUM
     4    | exp '-' exp
     5  ;
     6  %%


it will produce a warning announcing the existence of 
I<shift-reduce> conflicts:

  examples/eyapplanguageref$ eyapp ambiguities.eyp
  1 shift/reduce conflict (see .output file)
  State 5: reduce by rule 2: exp -> exp '-' exp (default action)
  State 5: shifts:
    to state    3 with '-'


when C<eyapp> finds warnings automatically produces a C<.output> file
describing the conflict.

What the warning is saying is that an expression like C<exp '-' exp> (rule 2) followed by a
minus C<'-'> can be parsed in more than one way. If we
have an input like C<NUM - NUM - NUM> the activity of a LALR(1) parser
(the family of parsers to which Eyapp belongs)
consists of a sequence of I<shift and reduce actions>. A I<shift action>
has as consequence the reading of the next token. A I<reduce action>
is finding a production rule that matches and substituting 
the rhs of the production by the lhs.  For input C<NUM - NUM - NUM>
the activity will be as follows (the dot is used to indicate where the next 
input token is):

                           .NUM - NUM - NUM # shift
                            NUM.- NUM - NUM # reduce exp: NUM 
                            exp.- NUM - NUM # shift
                            exp -.NUM - NUM # shift
                            exp - NUM.- NUM # reduce exp: NUM
                            exp - exp.- NUM # shift/reduce conflict

up this point two different decisions can be taken: the next description can be

                                  exp.- NUM # reduce by exp: exp '-' exp (rule 2)

or:

                            exp - exp -.NUM # shift '-' (to state 3)

that is why it is called a I<shift-reduce conflict>.

That is also the reason for the precedence declarations in the 
head section. Another kind of conflicts are I<reduce-reduce conflicts>.
They arise when more that rhs can be applied for a reduction
action.

Eyapp solves the conflicts applying the following rules:

=over

=item *  In a shift/reduce conflict, the default is the shift.

=item * In a reduce/reduce conflict, the default is to reduce by the
earlier grammar production (in the input sequence).

=item *  Precedences and associativities can be given to tokens in
the declarations section. This is made by a sequence of lines beginning
with one of the directives: C<%left>, C<%right>, or C<%nonassoc>, 
followed by a list of
tokens. All the tokens on the same line
have the same precedence and associativity; 
the lines are listed in order of increasing precedence.

=item * A precedence and associativity is associated with each grammar
production; it is the precedence and associativity of the I<last token> 
or I<literal> in the right hand side of the production.

=item * The C<%prec> directive can be used when
a rhs is involved in a conflict and has no tokens
inside or it has but the precedence of the last token leads
to an incorrect interpretation. A rhs can be followed by 
an optional C<%prec token> directive
giving the production the precedence of the C<token>

                          exp:   '-' exp %prec NEG { -$_[1] }

=item * If there is a shift/reduce conflict, and both the grammar production
and the input token have precedence and associativity associated
with them, then the conflict is solved in favor of the action (shift or
reduce) associated with the higher precedence. If the precedences are the
same, then the associativity is used; left associative implies reduce,
right associative implies shift, and non associative implies error.
The last is used to describe operators, like the operator C<.LT.> in FORTRAN, 
that may not associate with themselves. That is, because

                             A .LT. B .LT. C

is invalid in FORTRAN, C<.LT.> would be described with the keyword C<%nonassoc> in eyapp. 


=back

To solve a shift-reduce conflict between a production C<A --E<gt> SOMETHING>
and a token C<'a'> you can follow this procedure:

=over

=item 1. Edit the C<.output> file

=item 2. Search for the state where the conflict between the production and the token
is. In our example it looks like:

 pl@nereida:~/src/perl/YappWithDefaultAction/examples$ sed -ne '56,65p' ambiguities.output
 State 5:

        exp -> exp . '-' exp    (Rule 2)
        exp -> exp '-' exp .    (Rule 2)

        '-'     shift, and go to state 3

        '-'     [reduce using rule 2 (exp)]
        $default        reduce using rule 2 (exp)

=item 3. Inside the state there has to be a production of the type C<A --E<gt> SOMETHING.> 
(with the dot at the end)
indicating that a reduction must take place. There has to be also another production 
of the form C<A --E<gt> prefix . suffix>, where suffix can I<start> with the involved
token C<'a'>. 

=item 4. Decide what action shift or reduce matches the kind of trees you want.
In this example we want C<NUM - NUM - NUM> to produce a tree like
C<MINUS(MINUS(NUM, NUM), NUM)> and not C<MINUS(NUM, MINUS(NUM, NUM))>. We want the 
conflict in C<exp - exp.- NUM> to be solved in favor of the reduction
by C<exp: exp '-' exp>. 
This is achieved by declaring C<%left '-'>. 

=back

=head2 Error Recovery

The token name C<error> is reserved for error handling. This name can
be used in grammar productions; it suggests places where errors are
expected, and recovery can take place:

     line:
       '\n'         { undef }
       | exp '\n'   { print "$_[1]\n" if defined($_[1]); $_[1] }
       | error  '\n'
           {
             $_[0]->YYErrok;
             undef
           }


The parser pops its stack until
it enters a state where the token C<error> is legal. It then shifts
the token C<error> and proceeds to discard tokens until finding 
one that is acceptable. In the example
all the tokens until finding a C<'\n'> will be skipped. 
If no special error productions have been specified,
the processing will halt.

In order to prevent a cascade of error messages, the parser, after
detecting an error, remains in error state until three tokens have been
successfully read and shifted. If an error is detected when the parser
is already in error state, no message is given, and the input token is
quietly deleted. The method C<YYErrok> used in the example 
communicates to the parser
that a satisfactory recovery has been reached 
and that it can safely emit new error
messages.

You cannot have a literal I<'error'> in your grammar as it would
confuse the driver with the I<error> token. Use a symbolic token instead.

=head1 THE TAIL

The tail section contains Perl code. Usually it is empty, but you
can if you want put here your own lexical analyzer and 
error management subroutines.
An example of this is in
files C<examples/eyapplanguageref/List3_tree_d_sem.yp> (the grammar)
and C<use_list3_tree_d_dem.pl> (the client).

=head1 THE LEXICAL ANALYZER

The Lexical Analyzer 
is called each time the parser needs a new token.
It is called with only one argument (the parser object)
and returns a pair 
containing the next token and its associated attribute.

The fact that is a method of the parser object means that the parser
methods are accessible inside the lexical analyzer.

When the lexical analyzer reaches the end of input, it must return the
pair C<('', undef)>

=head2 AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF LEXICAL ANALYZERS

By default a lexical analyzer is built.
The C<eyapp> option C<-l>
can be used to inhibit the generation of 
the default lexical analyzer. In such case,
one must be explictly provided.


=head3 No token Definitions

When no token definitions are given in the head section, 
the default lexical analyzer simply assumes
that the token is the string literal. See this example in 
file C<examples/lexergeneration/simple.yp>:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ cat simple.yp
  %%
  A:    a
      | A d
  ;
  %%


The grammar does not describes the lexical analyzer nor the error default subroutine.
Eyapp will generate default lexical and error subroutines:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ eyapp -o simple.pl -TC simple.yp

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ ls -ltr | tail -2
  -rw-r--r-- 1 pl pl   27 2010-06-29 10:28 simple.yp
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 pl pl 3245 2010-06-29 10:35 simple.pl

The option C<-T> is equivalent to insert the C<%tree> directive in the head section.
Option C<-C> instructs the C<eyapp> compiler to produce an executable by setting the execution permits
(see C<simple.pl> permits above), inserting the appropriate she bang directive:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ head simple.pl | head -1
  #!/usr/bin/perl

and inserting a call to the package C<main> subroutine at the end of the generated parser:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ tail -6 simple.pl
  unless (caller) {
    exit !__PACKAGE__->main('');
  }


If no C<main> was provided, C<eyapp> will provide one.

Tokens C<a> and C<d> are assumed to represent strings C<'a'>
and C<'d'> respectively.

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ ./simple.pl -i -t -c 'a d d'
  A_is_A_d(A_is_A_d(A_is_a(TERMINAL[a]),TERMINAL[d]),TERMINAL[d])

The C<main> method provided by C<eyapp> accepts several options in the command line:

=over 2

=item * C<-t> Prints the abstract syntax tree 

=item * C<-i> Shows the semantic value associated with each terminal

=item * C<-c string> Indicates that the input is given by the C<string> that follows the option

=back

You can get the set of available options using C<--help>:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ ./simple.pl -h
  Available options:
    --debug                    sets yydebug on
    --nodebug                  sets yydebug off
    --file filepath            read input from filepath
    --commandinput string      read input from string
    --tree                     prints $tree->str
    --notree                   does not print $tree->str
    --info                     When printing $tree->str shows the value of TERMINALs
    --help                     shows this help
    --slurp                    read until EOF reached
    --noslurp                  read until CR is reached
    --argfile                  main() will take the input string from its @_
    --noargfile                main() will not take the input string from its @_
    --yaml                     dumps YAML for $tree: YAML module must be installed
    --margin=i                 controls the indentation of $tree->str (i.e. $Parse::Eyapp::Node::INDENT)

If we try to feed it with an illegal input, an error message is emitted:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ ./simple.pl -i -t -c 'a e d'
  Error inside the lexical analyzer near 'e'. Line: 1. File: 'simple.yp'. No match found.

In the example above we have taken advantage of the C<main> method provided by Eyapp.
If we want to keep in control of the parsing process, we can write a client program that 
makes use of the generated modulino:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ cat -n usesimple.pl
     1  #!/usr/bin/env perl
     2  use warnings;
     3  use strict;
     4
     5  use simple;
     6
     7  # build a parser object
     8  my $parser = simple->new();
     9
    10  # take the input from the command line arguments
    11  # or from STDIN
    12  my $input = join ' ',@ARGV;
    13  $input = <> unless $input;
    14
    15  # set the input
    16  $parser->input($input);
    17
    18  # parse the input and get the AST
    19  my $tree = $parser->YYParse();
    20
    21  print $tree->str()."\n";

Here is an example of execution:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ eyapp -T simple.yp
  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ ./usesimple.pl a d d
  A_is_A_d(A_is_A_d(A_is_a(TERMINAL),TERMINAL),TERMINAL)


=head3 Token Definitions: Regular Expressions

Eyapp extends the C<%token> directive with the syntax:

     %token TOKENID = /regexp/

If such definition is used, an entry with the shape: 

   /\G$regexp/gc and return ('TOKENID', $1);

will be added to the generated lexical analyzer.
Therefore the string associated with the first parenthesis in C</regexp/>
will be used as semantic value for C<TOKENID>. If C</regexp/> has no
parenthesis C<undef> will be the semantic value.
See this example:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ cat -n numlist.eyp
     1  %token NUM = /(\d+)/
     2  %token ID  = /(\w+)/
     3
     4  %%
     5  A:
     6        B
     7      | A B
     8  ;
     9
    10  B:
    11        ID
    12      | a
    13      | NUM
    14  ;
    15  %%


The order of the C<%token> declarations is important. 
In the example the token C<NUM> is a subset of the token C<ID>.
Since it appears first, it will be tried first:

     /\G(\d+)/gc and return ('NUM', $1);
     /\G(\w+)/gc and return ('ID', $1);

Also observe that token C<'a'> (line 12) is contained
in token C<ID>. However, any implicit token like this that appears in the
body section and was not 
declared using an explicit C<%token> directive in the
head section takes priority over the ones declared.
See the behavior of the former program:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ eyapp -TC numlist
  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ ./numlist.pm -t -i -c '4 a b'
  A_is_A_B(A_is_A_B(A_is_B(B_is_NUM(TERMINAL[4])),B_is_a(TERMINAL[a])),B_is_ID(TERMINAL[b]))

The lexical analyzer returned C<NUM> and not C<ID> when C<4> was processed,
also it returned C<a> and not C<ID> when C<'a'> was 
processed.

=head3 Token Definitions via Code

An alternative way to define a token is via Perl code:

      %token TOKENID = { ... }

in such case the code defining C<TOKENID> will be inserted
verbatim in the corresponding place of the generated lexical 
analyzer. When the code C<{ ... }>
is executed, the variable C<$_> 
contains the input being parsed.
The following example is equivalent to the one used in the previous
section:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/lexergeneration$ cat -n tokensemdef.eyp
     1  %token NUM = /(\d+)/
     2  %token ID  = { /\G(\w+)/gc and return ('ID', $1); }
     3
     4  %%
     5  A:
     6        B
     7      | A B
     8  ;
     9
    10  B:
    11        ID
    12      | a
    13      | NUM
    14  ;
    15  %%

=head3 Token Definitions: Controling whites

=head1 THE ERROR REPORT SUBROUTINE

The Error Report subroutine is also a parser attribute, 
and must be defined. By default C<Parse::Eyapp>
provides a convenient error handler. 

See the L<Parse::Yapp> pages and elsewhere documentation
on C<yacc> and C<bison> for more information.

=head1 USING AN EYAPP GRAMMAR

The following is an example of a program that uses the calculator explained 
in the two previous sections:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ cat -n usecalc.pl
     1  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
     2  use strict;
     3  use Calc;
     4
     5  my $parser = Calc->new();
     6  $parser->input(\<<'EOI'
     7  a = 2*3       # 1: 6
     8  d = 5/(a-6)   # 2: division by zero
     9  b = (a+1)/7   # 3: 1
    10  c=a*3+4)-5    # 4: syntax error
    11  a = a+1       # 5: 7
    12  EOI
    13  );
    14  my $t = $parser->Run();
    15  print "========= Symbol Table ==============\n";
    16  print "$_ = $t->{$_}\n" for sort keys %$t;

The output for this program is (the input for each output
appear as a Perl comment on the right):

  pl@nereida:~/src/perl/YappWithDefaultAction/examples$ eyapp Calc.eyp

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ ./usecalc.pl
  6
  Illegal division by zero.
  1

  Syntax error near ')' (line number 4).
  Expected one of these terminals: '-' '/' '^' '*' '+' '
  '
  7
  ========= Symbol Table ==============
  a = 7
  b = 1
  c = 22

=head1 LISTS AND OPTIONALS

The elements of the right hand side of a production (abbreviated I<rhs>) can be one of these:

  rhselt:     
        symbol    
      | code    
      | '(' optname rhs ')' 
      | rhselt STAR               /* STAR   is (%name\s*([A-Za-z_]\w*)\s*)?\*  */
      | rhselt '<' STAR symbol '>' 
      | rhselt OPTION             /* OPTION is (%name\s*([A-Za-z_]\w*)\s*)?\?  */
      | rhselt '<' PLUS symbol '>'
      | rhselt PLUS               /* PLUS   is (%name\s*([A-Za-z_]\w*)\s*)?\+  */

The C<STAR>, C<OPTION> and C<PLUS> operators provide a simple mechanism
to express lists:

=over

=item *
In Eyapp the C<+> operator indicates one or more repetitions of the element
to the left of C<+>, thus a rule like:

                        decls:  decl +

is the same as:

                        decls:  decls decl 
                             |  decl

An additional  symbol may be included  to indicate lists of elements 
separated by such symbol. Thus

                       rhss: rule <+ '|'>  

is equivalent to:

                       rhss: rhss '|' rule 
                           | rule

=item *
The operators C<*> and C<?> have their usual meaning: 0 or more for
C<*> and optionality for C<?>. Is legal to parenthesize 
a C<rhs> expression as in:

                       optname: (NAME IDENT)?

=back


=head2 The C<+> operator

The grammar:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ cat List3.yp 
  %semantic token 'c' 
  %{
  use Data::Dumper;
  $Data::Dumper::Indent = 1;
  %}
  %%
  S:      'c'+  'd'+ 
             { 
                print Dumper($_[1]);
                print Dumper($_[2]);
             } 
  ;
  %%

Is equivalent to:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ eyapp -v List3.yp; head -9 List3.output
  Rules:
  ------
  0:  $start -> S $end
  1:  PLUS-1 -> PLUS-1 'c'
  2:  PLUS-1 -> 'c'
  3:  PLUS-2 -> PLUS-2 'd'
  4:  PLUS-2 -> 'd'
  5:  S -> PLUS-1 PLUS-2


By default, the semantic action associated with a C<+> returns the lists of attributes
to which the C<+> applies:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ ./use_list3.pl
  Try input 'ccdd': ccdd
  $VAR1 = [ 'c', 'c' ];
  $VAR1 = [ 'd', 'd' ];


Observe that, in spite of C<'d'> being a syntactic token
the actions related with the C<d+> element (i.e. the actions associated
with the C<PLUS-2> productions) create the list of C<d>s.


The semantic associated with a C<+> changes 
when one of the tree creation directives is active (for instance C<%tree> or C<%metatree>)
or it has been explicitly requested with a call to the C<YYBuildingTree> method:

                            $self->YYBuildingTree(1);

Other ways to change the associated semantic are to use the 
C<yybuildingtree> option of C<YYParse>:

         $self->YYParse( yylex => \&_Lexer, yyerror => \&_Error,
                           yybuildingtree => 1,
                         # yydebug => 0x1F
         );
         
In such case the associated semantic action creates a node labelled

                     _PLUS_LIST

whose children are the attributes associated with the items in the plus list. 
As it happens when using the C<%tree> directive, I<syntactic tokens> are skipped.

When executing the example above but under the C<%tree> directive
the output changes. The C<-T> option tells the C<eyapp> compiler
to introduce an implicit C<%tree> directive>:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ eyapp -T List3.yp 

If we now run the client program with input C<ccdd> we get
a couple of syntax trees:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ ./use_list3.pl
  Try input 'ccdd': ccdd
  $VAR1 = bless( {
    'children' => [
      bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'c', 'token' => 'c' }, 'TERMINAL' ),
      bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'c', 'token' => 'c' }, 'TERMINAL' )
    ]
  }, '_PLUS_LIST' );
  $VAR1 = bless( { 'children' => [] }, '_PLUS_LIST' );

The node associated with the list of C<d>s is empty since
terminal C<d> wasn't declared semantic.

=head2 When Nodes Disappear from Lists

When under the influence of the C<%tree> directive
the action associated with a list operator
is to I<flat> the children in a single list.

In the former example, the C<d> nodes don't show up 
since C<'d'> is a syntactic token. However, it may happen that changing the status
of C<'d'> to semantic will not suffice.

When inserting the children, the tree (C<%tree>)  node construction
method (C<YYBuildAST>) omits any attribute that is not a reference.
Therefore, when inserting explicit actions, it is necessary to guarantee that 
the returned value is a reference or a semantic token 
to assure the presence of the value in the lists of children of the node.
Certainly you can use this property to prune parts of the tree.
Consider the following example:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ cat ListWithRefs1.eyp 
  %semantic token 'c' 'd'
  %{
  use Data::Dumper;
  $Data::Dumper::Indent = 1;
  %}
  %%
  S:      'c'+  D+ 
             { 
                print Dumper($_[1]);
                print $_[1]->str."\n";
                print Dumper($_[2]);
                print $_[2]->str."\n";
             } 
  ;

  D: 'd'
  ;

  %%

  sub Run {
    my ($self) = shift;
    return $self->YYParse( yybuildingtree => 1 );
  }


To activate the I<tree semantic> for lists we use the C<yybuildingtree>
option of C<YYParse> (line 26).

The execution gives an output like this:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ eyapp ListWithRefs1.eyp; ./use_listwithrefs1.pl
  Try input 'ccdd': ccdd
  $VAR1 = bless( {
    'children' => [
      bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'c', 'token' => 'c' }, 'TERMINAL' ),
      bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'c', 'token' => 'c' }, 'TERMINAL' )
    ]
  }, '_PLUS_LIST' );
  _PLUS_LIST(TERMINAL,TERMINAL)
  $VAR1 = bless( { 'children' => [] }, '_PLUS_LIST' ); _PLUS_LIST


Though C<'d'> was declared semantic the default action 
associated with the production C<D: 'd'> in line 16
returns C<$_[1]> (that is, the scalar C<'d'>). Since it is not
a reference it won't be inserted in the list of children of
C<_PLUS_LIST>.

=head2 Recovering the Missing Nodes

The solution is to be sure that the attribute is a reference:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ cat -n ListWithRefs.eyp
     1  %semantic token 'c' 
     2  %{
     3  use Data::Dumper;
     4  $Data::Dumper::Indent = 1;
     5  %}
     6  %%
     7  S:  'c'+  D+ 
     8        { 
     9           print Dumper($_[1]);
    10           print Dumper($_[2]);
    11        } 
    12  ;
    13  
    14  D: 'd'
    15       {
    16         bless { attr => $_[1], children =>[]}, 'DES';
    17       }
    18  ;
    19  
    20  %%
    21  
    22  sub Run {
    23    my ($self) = shift;
    24    return $self->YYParse( yybuildingtree => 1 );
    25  }


Now the attribute associated with C<D> is a reference 
and appears in the list of children of C<_PLUS_LIST>:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ eyapp ListWithRefs.eyp; ./use_listwithrefs.pl
  Try input 'ccdd': ccdd
  $VAR1 = bless( {
    'children' => [
      bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'c', 'token' => 'c' }, 'TERMINAL' ),
      bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'c', 'token' => 'c' }, 'TERMINAL' )
    ]
  }, '_PLUS_LIST' );
  $VAR1 = bless( {
    'children' => [
      bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'd' }, 'DES' ),
      bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'd' }, 'DES' )
    ]
  }, '_PLUS_LIST' );

=head2 Building a Tree with C<Parse::Eyapp::Node-E<gt>new>

The former solution consisting on writing I<by hand> the code to 
build the node may suffice when dealing with a single node.
Writing by hand the code to build a node is a cumbersome task.
Even worst: though the node built in the former example
looks like a C<Parse::Eyapp> node actually isn't. C<Parse::Eyapp> 
nodes always inherit from C<Parse::Eyapp::Node> and 
consequently have access to the methods in such package.
The following execution using the debugger illustrates the point:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ perl -wd use_listwithrefs.pl

  Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.28
  Editor support available.

  Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.

  main::(use_listwithrefs.pl:4):  $parser = new ListWithRefs();
    DB<1>  f ListWithRefs.eyp
  1       2       #line 3 "ListWithRefs.eyp"
  3
  4:      use Data::Dumper;
  5
  6       #line 7 "ListWithRefs.eyp"
  7       #line 8 "ListWithRefs.eyp"
  8
  9:                    print Dumper($_[1]);
  10:                   print $_[1]->str."\n";

through the command C<f ListWithRefs.eyp> we inform the debugger
that subsequent commands will refer to such file. Next 
we execute the program up to the semantic action
associated with the production rule C<S: 'c'+  D+> (line 9)

    DB<2> c 9     # Continue up to line 9 of ListWithRefs.eyp
  ccdd
  ListWithRefs::CODE(0x84ebe5c)(ListWithRefs.eyp:9):
  9:                    print Dumper($_[1]);

Now we are in condition to look at the contents 
of the arguments:

    DB<3> x $_[2]->str
  0  '_PLUS_LIST_2(DES,DES)'
    DB<4> x $_[2]->child(0)
  0  DES=HASH(0x85c4568)
     'attr' => 'd'
     'children' => ARRAY(0x85c458c)
          empty array

the C<str> method works with the object C<$_[2]> since
C<_PLUS_LIST_2> nodes inherit from C<Parse::Eyapp::Node>.
However, when we try with the C<DES> node we get an
error:

    DB<6> x $_[2]->child(0)->str
  Can't locate object method "str" via package "DES" at \
    (eval 11)[/usr/share/perl/5.8/perl5db.pl:628] line 2, <STDIN> line 1.
    DB<7>                      

More robust than the former solution of building the node I<by hand>
is to use the constructor C<Parse::Eyapp::Node-E<gt>new>:
The method C<Parse::Eyapp::Node-E<gt>new>
is uset to build forests of syntactic trees.

It receives a  list of terms describing the trees and - optionally -
a reference to a subroutine used to set up the attributes
of the just created nodes. After the creation 
of the trees the sub is called by C<Parse::Eyapp::Node-E<gt>new>
with arguments the list of references to the nodes (in the order
in which they appear in the terms, from left to right).
C<Parse::Eyapp::Node-E<gt>new> returns a list of references 
to the just created nodes. In a scalar context returns a reference to the first of such trees.
See an example:

  ~/LEyapp/examples$ perl -MParse::Eyapp -MData::Dumper -wde 0
  main::(-e:1):   0
    DB<1> @t = Parse::Eyapp::Node->new('A(C,D) E(F)', sub { my $i = 0; $_->{n} = $i++ for @_ })
    DB<2> $Data::Dumper::Indent = 0
    DB<3> print Dumper($_)."\n" for @t
  $VAR1 = bless( {'n' => 0,'children' => [bless( {'n' => 1,'children' => []}, 'C' ),
                                          bless( {'n' => 2,'children' => []}, 'D' )
                                         ]
                 }, 'A' );
  $VAR1 = bless( {'n' => 1,'children' => []}, 'C' );
  $VAR1 = bless( {'n' => 2,'children' => []}, 'D' );
  $VAR1 = bless( {'n' => 3,'children' => [bless( {'n' => 4,'children' => []}, 'F' )]}, 'E' );
  $VAR1 = bless( {'n' => 4,'children' => []}, 'F' );

See the following example in which the nodes associated with C<'d'> are
explicitly constructed:

  ~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ cat -n ListWithRefs2.eyp 
     1  %semantic token 'c' 
     2  %{
     3  use Data::Dumper;
     4  $Data::Dumper::Indent = 1;
     5  %}
     6  %%
     7  S:      'c'+  D+ 
     8             { 
     9                print Dumper($_[1]);
    10                print $_[1]->str."\n";
    11                print Dumper($_[2]);
    12                print $_[2]->str."\n";
    13             } 
    14  ;
    15  
    16  D: 'd'.d
    17       {
    18         Parse::Eyapp::Node->new(
    19           'DES(TERMINAL)', 
    20            sub { 
    21              my ($DES, $TERMINAL) = @_;
    22              $TERMINAL->{attr} = $d;
    23            }
    24         );
    25       }
    26  ;
    27  
    28  %%
    29  
    30  sub Run {
    31    my ($self) = shift;
    32    return $self->YYParse( yybuildingtree => 1 );
    33  }

    'children' => [
      bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'c', 'token' => 'c' }, 'TERMINAL' ),

    ]
  }, '_PLUS_LIST_1' );
  _PLUS_LIST_1(TERMINAL,TERMINAL)
  $VAR1 = bless( {

        ]
      }, 'DES' ),
      bless( {
        'children' => [
          bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'd' }, 'TERMINAL' )
        ]
      }, 'DES' )
    ]
  }, '_PLUS_LIST_2' );
  _PLUS_LIST_2(DES(TERMINAL),DES(TERMINAL))


=head2 The C<*> operator

Any list operator operates on the factor to its left.
A list in the right hand side of a production rule
counts as a single symbol.

Both operators C<*> and C<+> can be used 
with the format
C<X E<lt>* SeparatorE<gt>>.
In such case they describe lists of C<X>s separated by 
C<separator>. See an example:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ head -25 CsBetweenCommansAndD.eyp | cat -n
   1  # CsBetweenCommansAndD.eyp
   2
   3  %semantic token 'c' 'd'
   4
   5  %{
   6  sub TERMINAL::info {
   7    $_[0]->attr;
   8  }
   9  %}
  10  %tree
  11  %%
  12  S:
  13      ('c' <* ','> 'd')*
  14        {
  15           print "\nNode\n";
  16           print $_[1]->str."\n";
  17           print "\nChild 0\n";
  18           print $_[1]->child(0)->str."\n";
  19           print "\nChild 1\n";
  20           print $_[1]->child(1)->str."\n";
  21           $_[1]
  22        }
  23  ;
  24
  25  %%

The rule 

                            S: ('c' <* ','> 'd')*

has only two items in its right hand side: the (separated by commas) list
of C<c>s and the list of C<d>s.  The production rule is equivalent to:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ eyapp -v CsBetweenCommansAndD.eyp
  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ head -11 CsBetweenCommansAndD.output | cat -n
   1  Rules:
   2  ------
   3  0:      $start -> S $end
   4  1:      STAR-1 -> STAR-1 ',' 'c'
   5  2:      STAR-1 -> 'c'
   6  3:      STAR-2 -> STAR-1
   7  4:      STAR-2 -> /* empty */
   8  5:      PAREN-3 -> STAR-2 'd'
   9  6:      STAR-4 -> STAR-4 PAREN-3
  10  7:      STAR-4 -> /* empty */
  11  8:      S -> STAR-4

The semantic action associated with C<*> is to return 
a reference to a list with the attributes of the 
matching items.

When working -as in the example -
under a tree creation directive it returns
a node belonging to a class named C<_STAR_LIST_#number>
whose children are the items in the list.
The C<#number> is the ordinal number of the production rule
as it appears in the C<.output> file. The attributes must be 
references or associated with semantic tokens to be included 
in the list. Notice -in the execution of the former
example  that follows -
how the node for C<PAREN-3> has been 
eliminated from the tree. Parenthesis nodes are - generally -
obviated:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ use_csbetweencommansandd.pl
  c,c,cd

  Node
  _STAR_LIST_4(_STAR_LIST_1(TERMINAL[c],TERMINAL[c],TERMINAL[c]),TERMINAL[d])

  Child 0
  _STAR_LIST_1(TERMINAL[c],TERMINAL[c],TERMINAL[c])

  Child 1
  TERMINAL[d]

Notice that the comma (since it is a syntactic token) has 
also been suppressed.


=head2 Giving Names to Lists

To set the name of the node associated with a list operator the
C<%name> directive must precede the operator as in 
the following example:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ sed -ne '1,27p' CsBetweenCommansAndDWithNames.eyp | cat -n
   1  # CsBetweenCommansAndDWithNames.eyp
   2
   3  %semantic token 'c' 'd'
   4
   5  %{
   6  sub TERMINAL::info {
   7    $_[0]->attr;
   8  }
   9  %}
  10  %tree
  11  %%
  12  Start: S
  13  ;
  14  S:
  15      ('c' <%name Cs * ','> 'd') %name Cs_and_d *
  16        {
  17           print "\nNode\n";
  18           print $_[1]->str."\n";
  19           print "\nChild 0\n";
  20           print $_[1]->child(0)->str."\n";
  21           print "\nChild 1\n";
  22           print $_[1]->child(1)->str."\n";
  23           $_[1]
  24        }
  25  ;
  26
  27  %%

The grammar describes the language of sequences 

                  c,...,cd c,...,cd c,...,cd ....

The right hand side of the production has only one term which is a list, 
but the factor to which the star applies is itself a list. 
We are naming the term with the name C<Cs_and_d> and the factor with 
the name C<Cs>.

The execution shows the renamed nodes:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ use_csbetweencommansanddwithnames.pl
  c,c,c,cd

  Node
  Cs_and_d(Cs(TERMINAL[c],TERMINAL[c],TERMINAL[c],TERMINAL[c]),TERMINAL[d])

  Child 0
  Cs(TERMINAL[c],TERMINAL[c],TERMINAL[c],TERMINAL[c])

  Child 1
  TERMINAL[d]

=head2 Optionals

The C<X?> operator stands for the presence or omission
of C<X>.

The grammar:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ head -11 List5.yp | cat -n
       1  %semantic token 'c'
       2  %tree
       3  %%
       4  S: 'c' 'c'?
       5       {
       6         print $_[2]->str."\n";
       7         print $_[2]->child(0)->attr."\n" if $_[2]->children;
       8      }
       9  ;
      10
      11  %%

is equivalent to:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ eyapp -v List5
  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ head -7 List5.output
  Rules:
  ------
  0:      $start -> S $end
  1:      OPTIONAL-1 -> 'c'
  2:      OPTIONAL-1 -> /* empty */
  3:      S -> 'c' OPTIONAL-1

When C<yybuildingtree> is false the associated attribute 
is a list that will be empty if CX> does not show up.

Under the C<%tree> directive the action creates an C<_OPTIONAL>
node:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ use_list5.pl
  cc
  _OPTIONAL_1(TERMINAL)
  c
  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ use_list5.pl
  c
  _OPTIONAL_1

=head2 Parenthesis 

Any substring on the right hand side of a production rule can be grouped
using a parenthesis. The introduction of a parenthesis implies the introduction
of an additional syntactic variable whose only production 
is the sequence of symbols between the parenthesis. Thus the grammar:


  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ head -6 Parenthesis.eyp | cat -n
     1  %%
     2  S:
     3        ('a' S ) 'b'  { shift; [ @_ ] }
     4      | 'c'
     5  ;
     6  %%

is equivalent to:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ eyapp -v Parenthesis.eyp; head -6 Parenthesis.output
  Rules:
  ------
  0:      $start -> S $end
  1:      PAREN-1 -> 'a' S
  2:      S -> PAREN-1 'b'
  3:      S -> 'c'

By default the semantic rule associated with a parenthesis
returns an anonymous list with the attributes of the symbols 
between the parenthesis:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ cat -n use_parenthesis.pl
       1  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
       2  use Parenthesis;
       3  use Data::Dumper;
       4
       5  $Data::Dumper::Indent = 1;
       6  $parser = Parenthesis->new();
       7  print Dumper($parser->Run);
  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ use_parenthesis.pl
  acb
  $VAR1 = [
    [ 'a', 'c' ], 'b'
  ];
  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ use_parenthesis.pl
  aacbb
  $VAR1 = [
    [
      'a',
      [ [ 'a', 'c' ], 'b' ]
    ],
    'b'
  ];

when working under a tree directive or when the attribute
C<buildingtree> is set via the C<YYBuildingtree> method
the semantic action returns a node with children the attributes
of the symbols between parenthesis. As usual attributes
which aren't references will be skipped from the list of children.
See an example:


  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ head -23 List2.yp | cat -n
   1  %{
   2  use Data::Dumper;
   3  %}
   4  %semantic token 'a' 'b' 'c'
   5  %tree
   6  %%
   7  S:
   8        (%name AS 'a' S )'b'
   9          {
  10            print "S -> ('a' S )'b'\n";
  11            print "Attribute of the first symbol:\n".Dumper($_[1]);
  12            print "Attribute of the second symbol: $_[2]\n";
  13            $_[0]->YYBuildAST(@_[1..$#_]);
  14          }
  15      | 'c'
  16          {
  17            print "S -> 'c'\n";
  18            my $r = Parse::Eyapp::Node->new(qw(C(TERMINAL)), sub { $_[1]->attr('c') }) ;
  19            print Dumper($r);
  20            $r;
  21          }
  22  ;
  23  %%

The example shows (line 8)
how to rename a C<_PAREN> node. The C<%name CLASSNAME> goes
after the opening parenthesis.

The call to C<YYBuildAST> at line 13
with argumetns the attributes of the symbols on the right hand side
returns the node describing the current production rule.
Notice that line 13 can be rewritten as:

                    goto &Parse::Eyapp::Driver::YYBuildAST;

At line 18 the node for the rule is explicitly created
using C<Parse::Eyapp::Node-E<gt>new>. The handler passed as second argument
is responsible for setting the value of the atribute C<attr>
of the just created C<TERMINAL> node.

Let us see an execution:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ use_list2.pl
  aacbb
  S -> 'c'
  $VAR1 = bless( {
    'children' => [
      bless( {
        'children' => [],
        'attr' => 'c'
      }, 'TERMINAL' )
    ]
  }, 'C' );

the first reduction occurs by the non recursive rule. The execution
shows the tree built by the call to
C<Parse::Eyapp::Node->new>
at line 18.

The execution continues with the reduction or reverse derivation by the rule
C<S -E<gt> ('a' S )'b'>. The action at lines 9-14
dumps the attribute associated with C<('a' S)>
- or, in other words,  the attribute associated with the variable 
C<PAREN-1>. It also dumps the attribute of C<'b'>:

  S -> ('a' S )'b'
  Attribute of the first symbol:
  $VAR1 = bless( {
      'children' => [
        bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'a', 'token' => 'a' }, 'TERMINAL' ),
        bless( { 'children' => [ bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'c' }, 'TERMINAL' )
       ]
     }, 'C' )
    ]
  }, 'AS' );
Attribute of the second symbol: b

The last reduction shown is by the rule:
C<S -E<gt> ('a' S )'b'>:

  S -> ('a' S )'b'
  Attribute of the first symbol:
  $VAR1 = bless( {
    'children' => [
      bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'a', 'token' => 'a' }, 'TERMINAL' ),
      bless( {
        'children' => [
          bless( {
            'children' => [
              bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'a', 'token' => 'a' }, 'TERMINAL' ),
              bless( {
                'children' => [
                  bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'c' }, 'TERMINAL' )
                ]
              }, 'C' )
            ]
          }, 'AS' ),
          bless( { 'children' => [], 'attr' => 'b', 'token' => 'b' }, 'TERMINAL' )
        ]
      }, 'S_2' )
    ]
  }, 'AS' );
  Attribute of the second symbol: b


=head2 Actions Inside Parenthesis

Though is a practice to avoid, since it clutters
the code, it is certainly permitted to introduce
actions between the parenthesis, as in the example below:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ head -16 ListAndAction.eyp | cat -n
   1  # ListAndAction.eyp
   2  %{
   3  my $num = 0;
   4  %}
   5
   6  %%
   7  S:      'c'
   8              {
   9                print "S -> c\n"
  10              }
  11      |    ('a' {$num++; print "Seen <$num> 'a's\n"; $_[1] }) S 'b'
  12              {
  13                print "S -> (a ) S b\n"
  14              }
  15  ;
  16  %%

This is the output when executing this program with input C<aaacbbb>:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ use_listandaction.pl
  aaacbbb
  Seen <1> 'a's
  Seen <2> 'a's
  Seen <3> 'a's
  S -> c
  S -> (a ) S b
  S -> (a ) S b
  S -> (a ) S b

=head1 NAMES FOR ATTRIBUTES

Attributes can be referenced by meaningful names using the I<dot notation>
instead of using the classic error-prone positional approach:

                        rhs:  rhseltwithid *
                        rhseltwithid : 
                              rhselt '.' IDENT 
                            | '$' rhselt  
                            | rhselt

for example:

              exp : exp.left '-' exp.right  { $left - $right }

By qualifying the first appearance of the syntactic variable C<exp>
with the notation C<exp.left> we can later refer inside the actions
to the associated attribute using the lexical variable
C<$left>. 

The I<dollar notation> C<$A> can be used as an abbreviation
of C<A.A>. 

=head1 DEFAULT ACTIONS

When no action is specified both C<yapp> and C<eyapp>
implicitly insert the semantic action C<{ $_[1] }>. 
In C<Parse::Eyapp> you can modify such behavior using the C<%defaultaction { Perl code }>
directive. The C<{ Perl code }> clause that follows the C<%defaultaction>
directive is
executed when reducing by any production for which no explicit
action was specified.

=head2 An Example of Default Action: Translator from Infix to Postfix

See an example that translates an infix expression
like C<a=b*-3> into a postfix expression like C<a b 3 NEG * = >:

 # File Postfix.eyp (See the examples/ directory)
 %right  '='
 %left   '-' '+'
 %left   '*' '/'
 %left   NEG

 %defaultaction { return  "$left $right $op"; }

 %%
 line: $exp  { print "$exp\n" }
 ;

 exp:        $NUM  { $NUM }
         |   $VAR  { $VAR }
         |   VAR.left '='.op exp.right
         |   exp.left '+'.op exp.right
         |   exp.left '-'.op exp.right
         |   exp.left '*'.op exp.right
         |   exp.left '/'.op exp.right
         |   '-' $exp %prec NEG { "$exp NEG" }
         |   '(' $exp ')' { $exp }
 ;

 %%

 # Support subroutines as in the Synopsis example
 ...

The file containing the C<Eyapp> program must be compiled with C<eyapp>:

 nereida:~/src/perl/YappWithDefaultAction/examples> eyapp Postfix.eyp

Next, you have to write a client program:

 nereida:~/src/perl/YappWithDefaultAction/examples> cat -n usepostfix.pl
      1  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
      2  use strict;
      3  use Postfix;
      4
      5  my $parser = new Postfix();
      6  $parser->Run;

Now we can run the client program:

 nereida:~/src/perl/YappWithDefaultAction/examples> usepostfix.pl
 Write an expression: -(2*a-b*-3)
 2 a * b 3 NEG * - NEG

=head2 Default Actions, C<%name> and C<YYName>

In C<eyapp> each production rule has a name.
The name of a rule can be explicitly given by the programmer 
using the C<%name> directive. For example, in the piece of code
that follows the name C<ASSIGN> is given to the rule C<exp: VAR '=' exp>.

When no explicit name is given the rule has an implicit name.
The implicit name of a rule is shaped by concatenating
the name of the syntactic variable on its left, an underscore 
and the ordinal number of the production rule C<Lhs_#>
as it appears in the C<.output> file.
Avoid giving names matching such pattern to production rules.
The patterns
C</${lhs}_\d+$/> where C<${lhs}> is the name of the syntactic variable
are reserved for internal use by C<eyapp>.

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ cat -n Lhs.eyp
   1  # Lhs.eyp
   2
   3  %right  '='
   4  %left   '-' '+'
   5  %left   '*' '/'
   6  %left   NEG

   9    my $self = shift;

  11    bless { children => [ grep {ref($_)} @_] }, $name;
  12  }

Inside a semantic action
the name of the current rule can be recovered 
using the method C<YYName> of the parser object.

The default action (lines 8-12) computes as attribute of the left
hand side a reference to an object blessed in the name of the rule.
The object has an attribute C<children> which is a reference 
to the list of children of the node.
The call to C<grep> 

  11    bless { children => [ grep {ref($_)} @_] }, $name;

excludes children that aren't references. Notice that the lexical analyzer 
only returns references for the C<NUM> and C<VAR> terminals:

  59  sub _Lexer {
  60      my($parser)=shift;
  61
  62      for ($parser->YYData->{INPUT}) {
  63          s/^[ \t]+//;
  64          return('',undef) unless $_;
  65          s/^([0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?)//
  66                  and return('NUM', bless { attr => $1}, 'NUM');
  67          s/^([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*)//
  68                  and return('VAR',bless {attr => $1}, 'VAR');
  69          s/^(.)//s
  70                  and return($1, $1);
  71      }
  72      return('',undef);
  73  }

follows the client program:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ cat -n uselhs.pl
       1  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
       2  use Lhs;
       3  use Data::Dumper;
       4
       5  $parser = new Lhs();
       6  my $tree = $parser->Run;
       7  $Data::Dumper::Indent = 1;
       8  if (defined($tree)) { print Dumper($tree); }
       9  else { print "Cadena no vlida\n"; }

When executed with input C<a=(2+3)*b> the parser produces
the following tree:

  ASSIGN(TIMES(PLUS(NUM[2],NUM[3]), VAR[b]))

See the result of an execution:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ uselhs.pl
  a=(2+3)*b
  $VAR1 = [
    bless( {
      'children' => [
        bless( { 'attr' => 'a' }, 'VAR' ),
        bless( {
          'children' => [
            bless( {
              'children' => [
                bless( { 'attr' => '2' }, 'NUM' ),
                bless( { 'attr' => '3' }, 'NUM' )
              ]
            }, 'PLUS' ),
            bless( { 'attr' => 'b' }, 'VAR' )
          ]
        }, 'TIMES' )
      ]
    }, 'ASSIGN' )
  ];

The name of a production rule can be changed at execution time.
See the following example:

  $ sed -n '29,50p' YYNameDynamic.eyp | cat -n
     1  exp:
     2              NUM   { $_[1] }
     3          |   VAR   { $_[1] }
     4          |   %name ASSIGN
     5              VAR '=' exp
     6          |   %name PLUS
     7              exp '+' exp
     8          |   %name MINUS
     9              exp '-' exp
    10                {
    11                  my $self = shift;
    12                  $self->YYName('SUBTRACT'); # rename it
    13                  $self->YYBuildAST(@_); # build the node
    14                }
    15          |   %name TIMES
    16              exp '*' exp
    17          |   %name DIV
    18              exp '/' exp
    19          |   %name UMINUS
    20              '-' exp %prec NEG
    21          |  '(' exp ')'  { $_[2] }
    22  ;


When the client program is executed we can see the presence
of the C<SUBTRACT> nodes:

  pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ useyynamedynamic.pl
  2-b
  $VAR1 = [
    bless( {
      'children' => [
        bless( {
          'attr' => '2'
        }, 'NUM' ),
        bless( {
          'attr' => 'b'
        }, 'VAR' )
      ]
    }, 'SUBTRACT' )
  ];
